Sentiment Analysis on Musks's tweets between December 2020 and April 2021 and its impacts on DogeCoin and Bitcoin 



## The Musk Effect : Is it really the all powerful?

On 28 April 2021, the billionaire Elon Musk tweeted “The Dogefather”, spiraling the value of Dogecoin up by 32% from $0.27 to $0.34. Inspired by an internet meme featuring a shiba inu dog, a flurry of tweets by Musk on Twitter has injected value to the virtually worthless digital token to billions of dollars in market capitalization. Undeniably, we have witnessed the influence of Musk’s tweets  to mobilize financial markets, such as Tesla and Signal. This is because social media has introduced a new opportunity structure which has empowered individuals with the platform to express their opinions to the wider public sphere. 

As such, this was inspired by the desire to expound the relationship between social media activity and its influence on cryptocurrency markets. In particular, I would like to unravel on the following question: Is the Musk Effect really all that powerful? 

I analyzed Musk’s Twitter history between December 2020 and April 2021 and identified possible patterns with the market movement. The twitter dataset was selected from Kaggle which contained detailed information within the period of December 2020 and April 2021. Likewise, I explored cryptocurrency data matching this timeframe and broke down to the second intervals to elucidate the price trends thereafter.  


## Discussion 

The study has demonstrated how a culmination of social and political influences can impact the movements in the cryptocurrency markets. In this case, apart from the Musk effect, we see other possible news which could have resulted in the volatile trading volume and prices of these coins. Nevertheless, there are significant events which were a result of Musk’s tweets, more notably how his jokes have circulated on Twitter to impact the price of dogecoin. On the other hand appears to be less susceptible to his tweets unless there were stronger signs of the cryptocurrency from corporate interests of more influential individuals who communicate their opinions on it via social media, creating a stronger market movement. Hence, Musk’s tweets generally acted as a catalyst for the cryptocurrency movements but in some cases, these were reactionary posts as opposed to a constant trigger. 

In this new digital era, it is important to recognize the development of these trading activities are all attributed to the common reason : distributed and participatory nature of Twitter which enabled the autonomous construction of social networks. We witness different segments of society coming together and challenging the traditional notion where only the “big players” control the market. Political actors and news channels can easily amplify messages within this echo chamber, affecting investor sentiments. And of course, Musk, can easily influence his army of 40 million Twitter followers, reminding us that popular online actors can easily disrupt our traditional financial model and distort price signals.
